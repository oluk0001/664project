		<i>......I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal." 
		I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. 
		I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 
		I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. 
		I have a dream today. 
		I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. 
		I have a dream today. 
		I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together…

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
		One will not just pause but wonder what could motivate a man to gather more than two hundred thousand in audience to listen to a speech.  More surprising is that it happened at a time when the world was not as bombarded with so many media channels and electronic gadgets as we have today. It takes an exemplary leader with a strong vision and passion that is worth learning from. I was so excited to write about this man of vision, the exemplary leader that left his footprint on the sands of time. This unforgettable patriot forever reigns in the history of the American nation, American conscience, racial equality, human equanimity and most especially Black America and their journey to emancipation.

		The comprehensive Biography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by David L. Lewis (1970) and The Autobiography of  Martin Luther King, Jr. by Clayborne Carson, (1998) served as guide to this biographical portrait, though accompanied by other books and some other resources from the database of St. Thomas university library. The urge for a balanced portrait prompt the combination of Biography and Autobiography perspectives.

	Martin Luther King, Jr. was born on January 15, 1929 in Montgomery, Atlanta. He was born to the family with great religious influence strong enough to shape the kind of person he later became in life. His maternal grandfather, Reverend Alfred Daniel Williams, had founded Ebenezer Baptist Church and his father, Martin Sr., had made the church one of the largest and most prestigious Baptist churches in   Atlanta.  Martin Luther King, Jr. (Mike) had a happy childhood, been born to a financial secure black family at the time. His parents was totally involved in his life, his mother regularly took him to smaller churches in Atlanta. This played a major role in his later life. “Mike knows by instinct the code that unblocked the powerful emotions of black worshippers” Lewis (1970).

	His maternal grandfather Rev. Alfred Daniel Williams was one of his role models, though he spoke with broken English, he was a decisive man and fought vigorously for the liberty of the black race. Martin Luther King, Jr. might have learned from him some lessons, perhaps this inspired him later in life to follow the path he chose. He was born to the family of activists.  Rev. Alfred Daniel Williams played an important role in race relations. With other prominent citizens, Rev Alfred called for boycott of The Georgian Newspaper in the mid 1920’s, to protest the city bond issue that made no provisions for the construction of black public high schools. Memories of this boycott must have been very strong in his childhood, and inevitably it recalls the more famous bus boycott that he was to lead in Montgomery several decades later.

	Michael Luther King, his father had carried on very much in Reverend Williams’ footsteps. He once fought and defeated James Albert, his father, for drunkenly abusing his mother. The whites were periodically surprised by his forthright opposition to racial effrontery. Martin Luther King, Jr. must have learned the kind of audacity he displayed later in life from his father.  King, Sr. was always involved in his children’s affairs, on hand to advise, cajole and protect them. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s parents involvement in his early life and their brace for equality of all races is highly invaluable to him. It was the time of racial discrimination and ridicule, 'Don’t let this thing impress you. Don’t let it make you feel you’re not as good as white people. You’re as good as anyone else, and don’t you forget it.' His mother repeatedly affirmed to him. Martin Luther King. Jr. was motivated after listening to an eloquent visiting preacher and promised his mother, 'Someday, I’m going to have some big words like that' Martin Luther King (1943).

			 He worked rigorously on achieving this promise through practice and education. In some situations, though Mike (Martin Luther King, Jr.) could defend himself in a fight, his mode of defense was verbal rather than physical. 
Mike as an adolescent depicted the exponent of nonviolence, instead, he got himself engaged in professional boxing. He exhibited an almost philosophical stoicism, not a whimper, not a murmur or protest, his father explains. Mike’s love for books was traced back to his early life. His father explains how Mike loved to keep books around him in his early years even before he could read them, he just liked the idea of having them. 
Martin Luther King., Jr. is a man of favorable fate. It would appear his abhorrence for violence and sympathy for tragedy reached pathological proportions. Twice Mike attempts suicide when he was young, first attempt followed his brother’s accidental injury of his beloved maternal grandmother (it appeared his brother killed her). Mike hurled himself from the upstairs window of the house. A second attempt came when he was twelve, his paternal grandmother (Mrs. Williams) died of a heart attack after he had stolen away to sin by watching a parade. He leapt from the same window again and survived. On September 20, 1958, Martin was stabbed by a mentally deranged black woman in Harlem. It was a near fatal encounter for him. Martin underwent a delicate and dangerous operation at Harlem Hospital to get the letter opener out of his chest.
Mike (Martin Luther King, Jr.) shouldered responsibility at an early stage through newspaper delivery when he was eight; he spent most of his newspaper profits on clothes and foot wear. Martin Luther King, Jr. didn’t want to take after his father as a preacher. Though he was portrayed a perfect fit for the position by his keen intelligence and verbal polish. He got a transfer to Washington high and thereby skipped ninth grade, his extracurricular passion in oratory paid off in engaging in school debates.  While in Washington high, he was compelled by a bus driver to surrender his seat to a white passenger on a return from debate tour. He wrote of the experience 'It was a night I’ll never forget; I don’t think I have ever been so angry in my life'. He was wise enough to pursue his course in life without violence.
